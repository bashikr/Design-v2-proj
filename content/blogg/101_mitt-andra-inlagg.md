Time to move to central Stockholm
==================================

At the end of 2019, Bew Gorp has been in great demand for its products and therfore the company needs new collegues. As a result, the company decided to search for a larger local to absorb this amount of staff. After a lot of trouble finding a suitable place, we finally found the wished one that is located on Sveavägen 50, Stockholm.

Conference, teamwork rooms and more {#anchor-hit}
-----------------------------------
We are very proud to say that we have gotten a very fresh place. The new local has the capacity to accomodate more staff and there are many conference-ready rooms. Moreover, our employees will get more entertainment oppurtinities such as room to play music, video game room, and pingpong room.

One of the most important points that the company focused on when it was looking for a new local, was the restaurant. It has been our goal to find a big restaurant where everyone can have a place when the work pause starts. The main  goal of this process is to get employees to know more about each other. We are working on buliding a large family based on interconeectedness and understanding between our staff.


Believe it or not, Bew Gorp decided to  adopt a jacuzzi for its staff in case they wanted to relax.

Last but not least, the new local is located in the Stockholms down town. That said, at the time of break, employees can do something else like shopping, or visiting doctor or so. In addition, Bew's new place is located next to the bus and tram station. That makes our spolied employees save their time when they finish work.
